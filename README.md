DjangoZik
=========

web music player

How to start :
--------------
1. Change MUSIC_PATH in djangozik/settings.py to match your music folder
2. Change SECRET_KEY (ofc)
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run reset.sh (keep cool, it can be very long (parsing existing mp3))
5. Profit !

TODO :
------

1. Add Unit tests (dev in progress)
2. Change UI
3. Scan new files without re-scanning all the MUSIC_PATH
4. Add support for flac and ogg
